# Level 3 - Agenda

We will use the HTML tags we saw in the previous topics and write CSS to them in a separate file.

 * List items (ul, ol, li)
 * Styles that modify the box-model and styles that don't.
 	* Box model - calculate width
 	* Box-sizing (border-box)
 * Inline vs inline-block vs block
 * Look at CSS rules again - selectors, properties ( more complicated examples )

With the knowledge above we will build sample demo site live.
